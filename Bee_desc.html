                <h2>Honey Bee</h2>
                <p>The social insect known as a honey bee is well-known for its function in pollination and honey production. Each worker bee, drone, and queen bee in a colony has a specialized job to do. 
                    In addition to generating honey as a food source, honey bees pollinate flowers, which helps plants reproduce and produce food. Their crucial ecological contributions and intricate social
                    structure render them indispensable to agriculture and ecosystems. They do, however, face risks including habitat loss and pesticides, which highlights the significance of conservation efforts.</p>
