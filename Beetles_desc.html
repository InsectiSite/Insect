                <p>As a diverse group of insects, beetles make up almost 40% of all known insect species and are members of the Coleoptera order. The stiffened forewings, or elytra, that distinguish them. 
                    The world's beetles are diverse in their sizes, forms, colors, and ways of living. They live in a multitude of settings. They may eat other insects, manure, fungus, plants, and carrion.
